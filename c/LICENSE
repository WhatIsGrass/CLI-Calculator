# LICENSE

## Seriously?

Did you really think there was a real license for this? Come on! This whole repository is just for fun. There are calculators in every programming language you can imagine (and some you can't). It's like the United Nations of calculators, but with more code and less diplomacy.

### Here's the Deal:

- **Use it**: Go ahead, use any of this code wherever you want. World domination with a multi-language CLI calculator? Why not!
- **Copy it**: Make as many copies as you want. Share them with your friends, your enemies, random strangers on the street... or don't.
- **Modify it**: Improve it, break it, turn it into something new. Add a new language. What about Elvish?
- **No Warranty**: If this calculator somehow causes your computer to implode, your cat to meow in Morse code, or your coffee to taste like tea, we take no responsibility.

### In Conclusion:

There's no real license here. Just have fun, keep coding, and maybe learn a new language (programming or otherwise). Life's too short for serious licenses on a calculator repo!
