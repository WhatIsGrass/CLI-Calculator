## How to run

### Prerequisites

Before you can run this calculator, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cli-calculator.git
cd CLI-Calculator\javascript
```

### Running the Program

To start the calculator, run the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

### Usage

When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter whether the numbers are floats (`True/False`) and then to input the numbers accordingly. After that, you'll select the type of arithmetic operation you wish to perform (`addition`, `subtraction`, `multiplication`, `division`, `modulo`). The calculator will display the result of the operation.

#### Example

```
Is your first number a float? True/False: True
Enter a float number: 100.2
Is your second number a float? True/False: False
Enter an integer number: 50
Enter the operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo): addition
Result: 150.2
